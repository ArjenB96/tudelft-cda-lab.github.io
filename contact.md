## Open Positions

### PhD / Postdoc on Logging Engineering and Analysis

Developers and operations teams rely on monitoring to understand how 
the system behaves in production. Given the rich nature of data produced 
by large-scale systems in production and the popularization of machine learning, 
there is a increasingly trend to adopt artificial intelligence to automate operations.

Together with Adyen, we are seeking for a PhD (4 years) 
or a PostDoc (3 years) to work on applying machine learning 
techniques in the context of logging analysis and engineering. 
The goal is to come up with techniques to model, analyze and reason about 
the behavior of large-scale software systems.

We look for strong candidates with prior knowledge in machine/deep learning.
