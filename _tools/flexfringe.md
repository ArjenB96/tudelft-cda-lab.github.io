Flexfringe is a tool for learning finite state machines, also known as deterministic finite automata. 
It brings common merge heuristics such as alergia, EDSM, likelihood-ratio, and others, 
but also offers a flexible interface to easily add custom merge 
heuristics. It is based on Sicco Verwer's implementation of a state-merger in C++ called dfasat.
