A popular method in machine learning for supervised classification is a decision tree. In this work we propose a new framework to learn fuzzy decision trees using mathematical programming. More specifically, we encode the problem of constructing fuzzy decision trees using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) model, which can be solved by any optimization solver. We compare the performance of our method with the performance of off-the-shelf decision tree algorithm CART and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) using benchmark data-sets. Our initial results are promising and show the advantages of using non-crisp boundaries for improving classification accuracy on testing data.
