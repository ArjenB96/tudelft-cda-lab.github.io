Companies in maintenance logistics aspire to make better use of the increasing availability of real-time data from the many (inter)connected devices within the internet of things (IoT). Many such companies have in recent years taken a first key step in this direction by investing substantially in a data management infrastructure that ensures central and real-time availability of the raw data generated by the assets as well as key information on maintenance resources; e.g. the real-time location and status of field service engineers and spare parts, the status of repair centers, the availability of remote service engineers in the call center, etc. Companies are eager to leverage this investment to reduce cost and increase operational asset availability, by transitioning from traditional static maintenance logistics plans based on rigid task intervals to dynamic maintenance logistics policies fueled by real-time data. To ensure that real-time data can result in real-time actions two steps must be taken: Step 1) Dynamic identification of appropriate actions from real-time data; Step 2) Organization of the dynamic execution of these actions. Companies need to take both steps in order to successfully in order to successfully make the above-mentioned transition. There are challenges associated with both steps, and we develop approaches to address these challenges
